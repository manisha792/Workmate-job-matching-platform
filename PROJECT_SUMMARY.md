- **Purpose**: Organize jobs by various criteria
- **Implementation**: Sort by pay, location, or other fields
- **Features**: Both ascending and descending order support
- **Usage**: `/api/jobs/sort?by=<field>&order=<asc/desc>` endpoint

#### 3. Dijkstra's Algorithm (O(V + E log V))
- **Purpose**: Find nearest jobs based on student location
- **Implementation**: Uses string similarity as distance proxy
- **Features**: Location-based job recommendations
- **Usage**: `/api/jobs/suggested/<student_id>` endpoint

#### 4. Hungarian Algorithm (O(n¬≥))
- **Purpose**: Optimal job-student assignment
- **Implementation**: Considers location match and student ratings
- **Features**: Fair distribution of opportunities
- **Usage**: `/api/assignments/optimal` endpoint

### üé® User Interface

- GET /api/jobs/search?q=<query> - Search jobs (Linear Search)
- GET /api/jobs/sort?by=<field>&order=<asc/desc> - Sort jobs

Students:
- GET /api/students/<id> - Get student profile
- POST /api/students/<id>/rate - Rate student

Providers:
- GET /api/providers/<id> - Get provider profile

Advanced:
- POST /api/assignments/optimal - Optimal job assignment (Hungarian)
```

## üß™ Testing & Quality Assurance
